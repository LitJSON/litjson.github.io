Version v0.5.0 of LitJSON has been released.

New features and improvements:

* The JsonRader class now has two properties to control the reading of data
  from an input stream: EndOfInput and EndOfJson. The latter becomes
  true whenever a complete piece of JSON text has been read, while the
  former is a flag that becomes true when the stream itself reaches the end.
  This way, reading multiple JSON texts from the same input stream is
  straightforward.

* Added new base importers in JsonMapper for reading numeric values
  correctly into float and double members.

* Now Enum's can be imported/exported as numeric values.

* JsonData implements the IEquatable<T> interface now.


API changes:

  The following types are new:
    enum JsonType

  The following methods are new:
    IJsonWrapper.GetJsonType()
    IJsonWrapper.SetJsonType()

  The following properties are new:
    JsonReader.EndOfInput


Bug fixes:

* Correctly import/export properties that are read-only or write-only.

* Correctly convert null values when adding them as array elements or
  properties to a JsonData instance.

* Fixed conversion of empty JSON objects and arrays.
