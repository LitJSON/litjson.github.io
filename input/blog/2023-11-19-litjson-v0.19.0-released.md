### LitJson.Source

Which 0.19.0 we also ship [LitJson.Source](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LitJson.Source), which is a source code NuGet package, which means LitJSON gets compiled and embedded with your application/assembly. Useful if you need a zero-dependency JSON serializer within your own code.
