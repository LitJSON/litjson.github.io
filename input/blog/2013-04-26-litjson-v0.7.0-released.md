Version v0.7.0 of LitJSON has been released.

General changes and improvements:

* Simplified the building mechanism. Dropped the entire autotools
  infrastructure, and instead added a single Makefile to compile the project
  and run the tests with *GNU make*.

* Added `SkipNonMembers` property to `JsonReader`. When active, it allows to
  parse JSON data using `JsonMapper.ToObject<T>` and ignore any properties
  not available in the type `T`. Its default value is `true`.

* Started moving the documentation into Markdown format.

* Added a new section to the QuickStart Guide, regarding customisation of
  the library's behaviour.

Bug fixes:

* Convert `null` properties properly in `JsonData.ToJson`.

* Read nested arrays in `JsonMapper.ToObject` and `JsonMapper.ToObject<T>`
  correctly.
