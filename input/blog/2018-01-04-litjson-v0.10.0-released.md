Version v0.10.0 of LitJSON has been released.

This is the first release under the new LitJSON organization, it includes a few new major improvements and a couple of bug fixes.

__Features__

LitJSON has now been ported to .NET Core, which means it's now targets

* .NET Standard 2.0
* .NET Standard 1.5
* .NET Framework 4.5

Which makes it available to most of the .NET runtimes out there, please raise an issue/pullrequest if you are missing any target.

The [JsonWriter](https://litjson.net/api/LitJson/JsonWriter) now has the [LowerCaseProperties](https://litjson.net/api/LitJson/JsonWriter/B6391FAB) property which forces all properties to be outputted in lowercase.

The code base is now compatible and compilable under SQLCLR, which makes it an option for handling JSON with your CLR procedures and functions in SQL Server 2012 and up.

__Bugfixes__

Long/Int64 are now handled more robustly and can be upcast from an int.

Numbers are now handled in a culture invariant way, which means things will work the same regardless of culture on the clients maachine.

__Housekeeping__

There's been plenty of yak shaving before this release, to improve quality and simplify contribution to the project.

The project is now compiling multitargeted using .NET Core CLI, unit tests have migrated to work with newer versions of NUnit and the .NET CLI. This aslo means there's now an MSBuild solution and project files, so you can open and compile the project in Visual Studio, Visual Studio for Mac, VSCode and Jetbrains Rider.

A [Cake](https://cakebuild.net) build script has been added to orchestrate the build, test, packaging and deployment of the project. Invoking the Cake build script is most easily done via the bootstrappers, `build.ps1` (Windows) or `build.sh` (MacOS/Linux), which will fetch the specfied Cake version and the .NET SDK needed to build the project.

LitJSON now has CI configured on [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/litjson/litjson/branch/develop) and [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/LitJSON/litjson), which means each commit and pull requests now continously builds on Linux, MacOS and Windows.

We now automatically deploy each commit to [MyGet](https://www.myget.org/gallery/litjson), so you if needed you can use pre-release versions, and we're now also deploying each release to [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LitJson).
